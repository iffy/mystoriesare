        <h3>Years ago, I became ill; I found myself sitting for eight hours a day with nothing to do!</h3>

        <p>With time on my hands and a computer I had lying around, with memories in my head and thoughts surrounding me for the eight hours I sat
        on the couch, I was told by friends to write what I could remember of my past.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But memories are hard. Not just the remembering of them - sometimes recalling things can be difficult, but sometimes it
        is the memory itself that can be hard.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I found that with time and practice both the hard to remember memories and the hard to write memories became easier to write.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Soon without much notice I had my first story completed. I found that writing my memories down in story form, one memory at a time
        became easier. It became like eating my elephant one bite at a time.</p>
