        <p>There are many things that have happened to you that make up the story of your life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From the very early years of your life up to the days you are living now, your story is your
        own and it make you who you are.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This individuality should be shared with those who are important to you, allowing them to know
        you, from your perspective the way it actually happened.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What was the focus, that crucial point in your life that changed you, or were there more than
        time in your life that you felt moved to make changes. What stories can you tell that were the
        apex or the low points in your life and what lead up to them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As was stated, stories are difficult to write, for many reasons. Sometimes getting past these
        difficulties and writing them down can be great medicine for those telling the story. Sometimes
        they are still to painful to tell. But you being the author are allowed the benefit of deciding
        what gets told, how much gets told, or whether or not it get told at all.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Think of writing your stories as building or creating anything else. As you were once created,
        recreate yourself in the stories you write allowing others to see who you are and how you were built.</p>
