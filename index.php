        <p>What do you do with your family? What do you do as an individual?
        What memories do you keep track of, and can you share them with others?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Do you want them shared with others?</p>
        <br>
        <p>What is a family history after all, and what is it we want our descendants to know
        about us when we are gone? Our stories may be told, but will they be correct, will they
        really know what happened if we don't help them with the details?</p>
